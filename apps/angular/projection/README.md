> author: thomas-laforge

### Run Application

npx nx serve angular-projection
```

### Documentation and Instruction

Challenge documentation is [here](https://angular-challenges.vercel.app/challenges/angular/1-projection/).

- You must refactor the CardComponent and ListItemComponent.
- The NgFor directive must be declared and remain inside the CardComponent. You might be tempted to move it to the ParentCardComponent like TeacherCardComponent.
- CardComponent should not contain any NgIf or NgSwitch.
- CSS: try to avoid using ::ng-deep. Find a better way to handle CSS styling.
